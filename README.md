================

Fork this example on http://hanaio.cfapps.io and create a development machine for it.

Getting started
---------------

 1. Run the app with ```npm install && nodemon app.js``` from the command line in Codebox. This will install the app dependencies, run the app and listen for file changes on the file system.
 2. Open the app debug endpoint for your project from the HANA.IO dashboard. Keep the browser tab open.
 3. Open ```app.js``` with codebox, don't kill the server. Just change ```line 31``` to your name. 
 4. Refresh app debug endpoint tab. You should now see your changes right away. Easy, isn't it?
